# 🛰️ Satellite Orbit Prediction Using TLE and ML

This project predicts future orbital elements of Starlink satellites based on historical Two-Line Elements (TLE) using machine learning.

## ✨ Features
- Real-world satellite TLE data from Celestrak
- ML models (linear regression baseline)
- Visualization of orbital element predictions
- (Optional) LSTM for time-series modeling

## 📊 Sample Output

## 🔧 Tools
Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, sgp4, Matplotlib

## 📁 Folder Structure
See repo layout for code/data separation.

## 🚀 Future Work
- Integrate with SGP4 for ground-truth propagation
- Use LSTM for multi-step forecasting
- Predict full 3D position vectors
